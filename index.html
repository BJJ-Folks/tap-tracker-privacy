  <h1>Tap Tracker Android Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last Updated: April 3, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Tap Tracker Android ("Tap Tracker," "we," "us," or "our") is a mobile application designed to assist jiu-jitsu grapplers in tracking training submissions. With Tap Tracker, you can log how many times you submit your partner, how many times they submit you, the number of sparring rounds per day, and related notes, all displayed with a calendar and simple charts. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use Tap Tracker. We are committed to your privacy.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>Tap Tracker collects the following data, stored locally on your device:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>User-Generated Data</strong>: 
      <ul>
        <li>Submission counts (taps you give and receive).</li>
        <li>Timestamps (dates of training sessions).</li>
        <li>Number of sparring rounds per day.</li>
        <li>Notes you enter about your sessions.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: Minimal data (e.g., basic system info) required for app functionality and updates, but no unique identifiers (e.g., device ID, IP address) are collected.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect personal information like your name, email, or location unless you contact us directly.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use the data you provide to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Track and display your submission counts, rounds, and notes within the app.</li>
    <li>Show your training history via a calendar and pie chart.</li>
    <li>Improve app functionality and user experience through local processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All data processing occurs on your device—no personal data is sent to us.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>Tap Tracker does not share your data with third parties, except as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expo EAS Updates</strong>: The app fetches runtime updates from Expo’s servers (https://u.expo.dev/d850df41-ebe1-4bf6-9bf9-f75ac2dafee4) to deliver new features or fixes. This involves app configuration data only—no user data is sent to Expo.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored locally on your device using <code>@react-native-async-storage</code> and <code>@react-native-fs</code>. We do not transmit it to external servers. We take reasonable steps to secure this data within the app, but you are responsible for securing your device (e.g., with a passcode). No system is fully secure, so we encourage device-level precautions.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Tap Tracker uses these third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Expo</strong>: For app updates and development framework. See <a href="https://expo.dev/privacy">expo.dev/privacy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Chart Libraries</strong>: We use <code>react-native-chart-kit</code> or <code>victory-native</code> to display a pie chart of your submission data. These operate locally and do not send data externally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Tap Tracker is not targeted at children under 13, though they may use it. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you’re a parent or guardian and believe we’ve collected such data, contact us at dcllive090@gmail.com, and we’ll delete it.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy as needed. Changes will be posted here with an updated “Last Updated” date. Check back periodically.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>For questions or concerns, reach us at:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email</strong>: dcllive090@gmail.com</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thank you for using Tap Tracker Android to enhance your jiu-jitsu training!</p>
